        <h2>History</h2><br><br>
        <p>The club was founded on 9 March 1908 as Football Club Internazionale,
          following the schism with the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now A.C. Milan).
          The name of the club derives from the wish of its founding members to accept foreign
          players as well as Italians. In 1922, Inter remained in the top league after winning two play-offs.
          Six years later, during the Fascist era, the club was forced to merge with the Unione Sportiva Milanese
          and was renamed Società Sportiva Ambrosiana. The team wore white jerseys during this time with a red cross
          emblazoned on it.</p>

        <h2>Colours and Badge</h2><br><br>
        <p>Since its founding in 1908, Inter have worn black and blue stripes.
          It is rumoured that black was chosen to represent night and blue was chosen to represent the sky.
          Aside from a short period during World War II, Inter continued to wear the black and blue stripes,
          earning them the nickname Nerazzurri. For a period of time, however, Inter were
          forced to abandon their black and blue uniforms. In 1928, Inter's name and philosophy
          made the ruling Fascist Party uneasy. As a result, during the same year the
          20-year-old club was merged with Unione Sportiva Milanese.</p>

        <h2>Stadium</h2><br><br>
        <p>The team's stadium is the 80,018 seat San Siro, officially known as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza
          after the former player who represented both Milan and Inter. The more commonly used name,
          San Siro, is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro has been the home of
          Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan's chairman at the time,
          Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13 and a half months to complete. The
          stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with
          Inter,
          when they were accepted as joint tenant.</p>
